# Positional-Signal-Processing

## Description of the project
Given a labeled dataset, whose data is multivariate timeseries sampled from sensors included in a smart watch and the labels are the type of the activity the user does, we are asked to create an automated methodto classify each activity by the sensors readings.

## Libraries
1. Numpy: The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python programming language.
2. Pandas: Data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language.
3. Sklearn: Tools for predictive data analysis, built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
4. Seglearn: Flexible approach to multivariate time series and contextual data for classification, regression, and forecasting problems.
5. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
