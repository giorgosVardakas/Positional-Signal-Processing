# Positional-Signal-Processing

## Description of the project
Labeled data were collected from sensors which were in smartwatches. There were three types of sensors included, accelerometer, gyroscope and heart rate sensor. The frequency of accelerometer and gyroscope is 10Hz and the heart rate sensor's is 1Hz.

Given a labeled dataset, whose data is multivariate timeseries sampled from sensors included in a smart watch and the labels are the type of the activity the user does, we are asked to create an automated methodto classify each activity by the sensors readings.

The main goal of the project is to create an automated method in order to classify each activity according to the sensors' readings.
